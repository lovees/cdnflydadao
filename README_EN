Dear cdnfly users:
At present, a login security vulnerability has been found, which needs to be temporarily repaired according to the following methods. Find - a domain name that only you know, this domain name is used for administrator login.
For example, the domain name does not need to include http://, the path is: system management ---> system settings ---> user related, restrict the administrator to only log in from this domain name
